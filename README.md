# Data Platform for Audio Streaming Service

This data platform is design to solve the following problems:
- Business Intelligence: prepared data will allow analytics to assess the state of the business at various levels. 
- _[plans]_ Proactive actions based on user activity: architechture should allow making offers to users in the app based on real-time data.

To acchive the goals above the data must meet the following requirements: 
- Data must be in a centralized repository; 
- Events should be written to the storage with a delay of no more than one minute;
- Must reflect business process;
- Must be clean and reliable;
- Must be available 24/7;
- Must be documented.


## Architecture Design

## Data Generation 

The project is based on events generated by https://github.com/viirya/eventsim. This events reflect user behaviour in a fake music web site (like Spotify).
